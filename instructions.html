        <h1>Your turn!</h1>
        Now that you've seen this basic HTML page and some CSS styling, feel free to visit <a href="https://github.com/Georgetown-Disruptive-Tech">our github repository</a> for more templates. Credit is given on all of the templates as I did not write them myself. 
        <br>
        <br>
        If you are feeling adventurous, write your CSS + HTML yourself based off of this page. For help, visit:

            <li><a href="http://google.com/">Google</a> is your friend!! If you have a question, ask google because someone else has probably posted is somewhere before.</li>

        </ul>
        
        <p>
            &emsp; Lastly, I suggest looking at other websites, whether they be retail, personal, or restaurant websites, and "inspecting element" on any page you like. You can find some cool HTML + CSS that these sites use and apply it to your own website. 
            <br>
            &emsp; A lot of the cool transitions and features you see on websites require scripting (which is done in a language like Javascript) or a more developed backend that interacts with an API (application program interface), databases and other structured frameworks.
